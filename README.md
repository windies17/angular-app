# angular-app
Angular JS is changing the web but just how do you get started? I intend to show you how to get started using angular js using yeoman

How do I get started in angular js?

First off we need node js and npm you can install this on your mac by typing

$ brew install node

then check on your terminal you have it installed by typing

$ node -v
$ npm -v

We want to start off with installing yeoman via your command line. If you are new and don't know what the command line
is, it is the application called terminal on the mac.

You can install yeoman by typing

npm install -g yo

This -g command puts yeoman on your computer globally so any time you need to start using yeoman all you need to do is type

yo

WHAT IS YEOMAN?

Yeoman is a scaffolding framework that allows you to add generators e.g angular js, ember js and then builds it for you.

HOW DO YOU INSTALL A GENERATOR?

You can install a generator by typing

npm install -g generator-angular

Once that has downloaded you are now able to type

yo

then it will prompt you to run a generator, press return on

❯ Angular 

It will ask you for some options, click on the options then watch the magic happen
